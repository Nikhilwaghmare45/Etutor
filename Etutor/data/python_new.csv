Concept,Description
Variables,Containers for storing data values.
Data Types,"Different types of values a variable can hold, like int, float, and str."
Lists,"Ordered collection of elements, mutable and indexed."
Tuples,Immutable ordered collection of elements.
Dictionaries,Key-value pairs used for mapping and storing data.
Sets,Unordered collection of unique elements.
